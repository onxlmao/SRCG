| `-h`, `--help`                             | Show this help message and exit. |
| `--share`                                  | Create a public URL.
| `--listen`                                 | Make the web UI reachable from your local network. |
| `--listen-host LISTEN_HOST`                | The hostname that the server will use. |
| `--listen-port LISTEN_PORT`                | The listening port that the server will use. |

Once the following output message `Running on local URL:  http://127.0.0.1:7860` appears, you can click on the link to open a tab with the WebUI.

### Download RVC models via JSON Gallery

![](images/webui_dl_model.png?raw=true)

Navigate to the `Download model` tab and open the **From JSON Index** sub-tab. Here you will find:

1. **Model Gallery** - A visual grid of all available voice models with character images. Each card shows the model name and a status indicator:
   - ✅ = Already downloaded and ready to use
   - ⬇️ = Not yet downloaded
2. **Click to Select** - Click any model card in the gallery to instantly select it in the dropdown below. The preview panel on the right will show the model's image, description, credit, and download status.
3. **Dropdown** - Alternatively, select a model from the dropdown list to browse details before downloading.
4. **Download Model** - Click the button to download the selected voice model. Once downloaded, it becomes available in the `Generate` tab after clicking `Refresh Models`.
5. **Download Required Models** - One-click download for all required base models (hubert, rmvpe, MDX-Net) from `models_manifest.json`.
6. **Check Model Status** - View which required models and voice models are present on your system.

The gallery currently includes **55 voice models** from anime, games, and real artists, each with character artwork sourced from AniList, Enka Network, and Zerochan. Image files are cached locally in `images/models/` after first download.

### Download RVC models via URL

![](images/webui_dl_model.png?raw=true)

Navigate to the `Download model` tab and open the **From HuggingFace/Pixeldrain URL** sub-tab. Paste the download link to the RVC model and give it a unique name.
You may search the [AI Hub Discord](https://discord.gg/aihub) where already trained voice models are available for download. You may refer to the examples for how the download link should look like.
The downloaded zip file should contain the .pth model file and an optional .index file.

### Download RVC models from Public Index

Navigate to the `Download model` tab and open the **From Public Index** sub-tab. Click `Initialize public models table` to load the available models. Use tags and search to filter the list. Click a row to autofill the download link and model name, then click `Download`.

### Upload RVC models via WebUI

![](images/webui_upload_model.png?raw=true)

For people who have trained RVC v2 models locally and would like to use them for AI Cover generations.
Navigate to the `Upload model` tab, and follow the instructions.
Once the output message says `[NAME] Model successfully uploaded!`, you should be able to use it in the `Generate` tab after clicking the refresh models button!


### Running the pipeline via WebUI

![](images/webui_generate.png?raw=true)

- From the Voice Models dropdown menu, select the voice model to use. Click `Refresh Models` if you added the files manually to the [rvc_models](rvc_models) directory to refresh the list.
- In the song input field, copy and paste the link to any song on YouTube or the full path to a local audio file.
- Pitch should be set to either -12, 0, or 12 depending on the original vocals and the RVC AI model. This ensures the voice is not *out of tune*.
- Other advanced options for Voice conversion and audio mixing can be viewed by clicking the accordion arrow to expand.
- **Note:** If audio has already been separated for the same input song, it will be reused automatically to save processing time.

Once all Main Options are filled in, click `Generate` and the AI generated cover should appear in a less than a few minutes depending on your GPU.

## Usage with CLI

### Manual Download of RVC models

Unzip (if needed) and transfer the `.pth` and `.index` files to a new folder in the [rvc_models](rvc_models) directory. Each folder should only contain one `.pth` and one `.index` file.

You can also download models directly using the CLI:

```bash
# Download a specific voice model by name
python src/download_models.py --voice "Klee"

# List all available voice models
python src/download_models.py --list

# Check which models are downloaded
python src/download_models.py --check
```

### Running the pipeline via CLI

To run the AI cover generation pipeline using the command line, run the following command.

```
python src/main.py [-h] -i SONG_INPUT -dir RVC_DIRNAME -p PITCH_CHANGE [-k | --keep-files | --no-keep-files] [-ir INDEX_RATE] [-fr FILTER_RADIUS] [-rms RMS_MIX_RATE] [-palgo PITCH_DETECTION_ALGO] [-hop CREPE_HOP_LENGTH] [-pro PROTECT] [-mv MAIN_VOL] [-bv BACKUP_VOL] [-iv INST_VOL] [-pall PITCH_CHANGE_ALL] [-rsize REVERB_SIZE] [-rwet REVERB_WETNESS] [-rdry REVERB_DRYNESS] [-rdamp REVERB_DAMPING] [-oformat OUTPUT_FORMAT]
```

## Model Management System

SRCG uses a JSON-based model management system for easy downloading and organization of voice models and required base models.

### models_manifest.json

Located in the project root, this file defines the required base models needed for the pipeline to function:

```json
{
    "hubert_base.pt": "https://huggingface.co/.../hubert_base.pt",
    "rmvpe.pt": "https://huggingface.co/.../rmvpe.pt",
    "mdxnet_models/UVR-MDX-NET-Voc_FT.onnx": "https://huggingface.co/.../UVR-MDX-NET-Voc_FT.onnx",
    "mdxnet_models/UVR_MDXNET_KARA_2.onnx": "https://huggingface.co/.../UVR_MDXNET_KARA_2.onnx",
    "mdxnet_models/Reverb_HQ_By_FoxJoy.onnx": "https://huggingface.co/.../Reverb_HQ_By_FoxJoy.onnx"
}
```

Each key is the relative path from the project root where the file will be saved. The value is the download URL. These models are downloaded to the project root directory (not inside `rvc_models/`).

### rvc_models/list.json

This file contains the curated list of downloadable voice models displayed in the gallery. Each entry is a flat JSON object:

```json
[
    {
        "name": "Klee",
        "url": "https://huggingface.co/qweshkka/Klee/resolve/main/Klee.zip",
        "image": "https://enka.network/ui/UI_AvatarIcon_Klee.png",
        "description": "Klee from Genshin Impact",
        "credit": "qweshsmashjuicefruity"
    }
]
```

| Field          | Required | Description |
|----------------|----------|-------------|
| `name`         | Yes      | Unique identifier for the model. Also used as the folder name in `rvc_models/`. |
| `url`          | Yes      | Direct download URL to a zip file containing `.pth` (and optionally `.index`) files. Pixeldrain URLs are auto-converted. |
| `image`        | No       | URL to a character/model image for the gallery. Falls back to `images/default_model.png` if empty or broken. |
| `description`  | No       | Brief description of the model/character shown in the preview panel. |
| `credit`       | No       | Credits the original model trainer/creator. |

### Adding your own models to the gallery

To add a new model to the gallery, simply append a new entry to `rvc_models/list.json`:

```json
{
    "name": "YourModelName",
    "url": "https://huggingface.co/your-repo/resolve/main/YourModel.zip",
    "image": "https://example.com/your-model-image.jpg",
    "description": "Description of your model",
    "credit": "YourName"
}
```

The model will automatically appear in the gallery on the next WebUI launch. Image URLs from AniList, Enka Network, and Zerochan are supported. Images are cached locally in `images/models/` after the first download.
